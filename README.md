# ipfs-upload-app

This is the front-end web app that pairs with [this back-end web server](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/ipfs-upload-server). The front end part is forked from this [gatsby-ipfs-template](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/gatsby-ipfs-template) repository.

This web app allows someone to upload a file and pay with BCH to have it hosted on an IPFS server for 1 month.
